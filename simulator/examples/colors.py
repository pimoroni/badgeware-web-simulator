# Three ways to build a spread of colour — and why they look so different.
#
#   color.hsv(h, s, v)        h, s, v   0-255 (h runs once around the hue wheel)
#   color.oklch(L, C, h, a)   L, C, a   0-255, hue in degrees (perceptually even)
#   color.rgb(r, g, b)        channels  0-255
#
# Watch the *brightness* along each bar. HSV sweeps hue evenly but its yellow
# glares while its blue sinks — equal v, very unequal perceived lightness. OKLCH
# sweeps the same hues but holds a flat perceived lightness (L and C fixed). And
# a straight RGB channel blend between two vivid colours slumps through a muddy
# grey middle, because RGB isn't a perceptual space at all.
